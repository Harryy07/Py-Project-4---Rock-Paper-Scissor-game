# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. This project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts such as **randomization**, **if-elif statements**, and **lists**.

## Features
- A fun interactive game between the user and the computer.
- Randomized computer choices using Python's `random` module.
- Clear outcomes (win, lose, or draw) based on user and computer inputs.

## How It Works
1. The user selects **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
2. The computer randomly picks one of the three choices.
3. The game logic determines the winner based on the classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
4. The result is displayed to the user.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- **Randomization:** Used to generate the computer's choice.
- **Conditional Statements:** `if-elif` conditions evaluate the game rules.
- **Lists:** Simplify the management of choices (rock, paper, scissors).

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
